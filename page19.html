<div>Over qualification does not matter. What matters is minimum required qualification and experience?</div><br><br><div>
</div><div>#2 Answer
</div><div>I don't think so if you think that I'm overqualified for this post I am happy for it because I can give more beneficial to company.</div><br><br><div>
</div><div>#3 Answer
</div><div>Sir. I don't think so I am over qualified for the job you're offering because if that would have been the case there would be a chance for further negotiation in terms of higher job level, more salary to be offered to me. I don't see any of that happening here. So nor I am over neither under qualified for the job. I am a perfect fit.</div><br><div><br></div><div>#4 Answer
</div><div>No sir I am not overqualified. I am sure that my performance is equal to what would you want from me.</div><br><br><div>
</div><div>#5 Answer
</div><div>No, sir I am not overqualified. I applied for this job as per company requirements only.</div><br><br><div>
</div><div>#6 Answer
</div><div>No sir, I understand the difference between qualification &amp; implementation. I am looking for the opportunity where I can implement my qualification. Learning never comes end.</div><br><div><br></div><div>#7 Answer
</div><div>Well to be frank sir, I believe that in real life skills are appreciated more than qualification. My resume may reveal my education but skills I have to develop. I think this is the best place for it. My determination and enthusiasm will bring mutual benefits.</div><br><br><div>
</div><div>#8 Answer
</div><div>Am qualified but not over qualified. I have the knowledge &amp; I can implement it in my works. Whatever the work it doesn't matter.</div><br><br><div>
</div><div>#9 Answer
</div><div>Sir, as I am a fresher there is no possibility or matter of speaking over qualification because I am just a beginner having theoretical knowledge and need to learn much more in the field.</div></div>
